## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
- Check if the issue you want to fix already exists in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-dashboard/issues)
- If not, create a new issue describing the bug or feature you want to work on

## Development Environment Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Set up the development environment by installing dependencies
4. 4. Create a branch for your work
5. Run the development server
> **Note**: This project is optimized for Node.js v16. If you're using newer versions, see the README.md for compatibility instructions.

## Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Latest development changes
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-name` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/fix-name` - Urgent fixes for the production branch

## Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Adhere to our [code style guidelines](#code-style-guidelines)
3. Write meaningful commit messages that clearly explain what changes you're making
4. Keep your commits focused and avoid including unrelated changes
5. Push your changes to your forked repository

   
## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to our `develop` branch
2. In the PR description, clearly describe the changes you've made and reference any related issues
3. Be prepared to address feedback and make additional changes if requested
4. PRs need approval from at least one maintainer before they can be merged

## Code Style Guidelines

We follow a consistent code style to maintain readability and consistency across the codebase:

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for React components and class names
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Format your code using ESLint and our project's configuration

## Testing Guidelines

All new features and bug fixes should include appropriate tests:

1. Write tests for any new functionality
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs

3. Aim for good test coverage of your code
4. For complex UI components, include visual tests or screenshots

## Documentation Guidelines

Good documentation is crucial for maintaining and growing the project:

1. Update the README.md if you add new features or change functionality
2. Document all new components, hooks, and utility functions with JSDoc comments
3. Include code examples where appropriate
4. Ensure documentation is clear and understandable for new users

## Issue Reporting
